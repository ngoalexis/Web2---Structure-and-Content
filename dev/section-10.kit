                    <p>The &lt;a&gt; tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most
                        important attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's
                        destination.</p>

                            <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
